                [00:00.671]Even living is pointless for me,
                [00:02.226]So just let me go already.
                [00:06.747]Because I don’t even have a single dream anyway.
                [00:09.315]TUYU - Hide and Seek Alone
                [00:19.097]Everything can always be replaced, right?
                [00:21.510]Even I’ve become such a scrap
                [00:23.902]Being in this state,
                [00:26.403]I got discarded just like that
                [00:28.926]Even the new environment isn’t coming,
                [00:31.438]In a scenery that remains unchanged,
                [00:33.903]I’ve been looking at the same flower all along,
                [00:36.213]That withered flower.
                [00:38.796]You, a worldly-wise figure,
                [00:40.659]You, a worldly-wise figure, are glorious,
                [00:43.729]Unlike me, who have always made mistakes.
                [00:48.563]Even living is pointless for me,
                [00:50.165]So just let me go already.
                [00:53.531]Because I’ll just be a nuisance
                [00:54.841]And only cause you more troubles.
                [00:58.512]I'm sick of hearing any words of salvation,
                [01:01.343]So I just cover my ears.
                [01:03.274]Falling along with scattering petals,
                [01:06.756]I just want to live in peace.
                [01:08.354]I’ve been playing hide-and-seek alone all along.
                [01:20.669]No matter how much I can complain
                [01:22.981]There's nothing beyond that
                [01:25.525]Even breaking this negative chain,
                [01:27.939]Isn't there any other hobbies I have?
                [01:30.364]I know it’s a bad thing to my eyes,
                [01:32.792]But I won’t feel better unless I see it.
                [01:35.239]That's why I'm watching the rain that never stops,
                [01:37.724]That dirty never-ending rain.
                [01:40.268]You, an excellent risk taker,
                [01:42.131]You, an excellent risk taker, are strong
                [01:45.403]As for me, who has only stayed in comfort zone,
                [01:48.638]As for me, who has only stayed in comfort zone, it’s impossible.
                [01:50.124]Even living is pointless for me,
                [01:51.834]So just let me go already.
                [01:55.091]The rain is falling and dancing in its own way,
                [01:56.952]Ruining my precious notebook.
                [01:59.977]That little scream I wrote down from the bottom of my heart
                [02:04.940]Disappeared in the dull sky,
                [02:08.479]And became one with the lightning.
                [02:09.929]I’ve been playing hide-and-seek alone all along.
                [02:12.348]Don't look for me,
                [02:15.013]Please don't call out to me,
                [02:17.525]Don't find me, just leave things as it is
                [02:22.185]Even living is pointless for me,
                [02:23.747]So just let me go already.
                [02:28.340]Because I don’t even have a single dream anyway.
                [02:30.880]Because I don’t deserve to laugh anyway.
                [02:33.841]Even living is pointless for me,
                [02:35.544]So just let me go already.
                [02:38.770]Even if I were reborn, the afterlife and beyond
                [02:41.179]Would go all wrong.
                [02:43.570]I'm sick of hearing any words of salvation,
                [02:46.617]So I just cover my ears.
                [02:48.562]At least I want to become a beautiful flower
                [02:51.983]Before to be picked
                [02:53.643]I’ve been playing hide-and-seek alone all along.
                [02:56.239](Don't look for me)
                [02:58.869](Please don't call out to me)
                [03:01.194](Don't find me)";
